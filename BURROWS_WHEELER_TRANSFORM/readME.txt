The following folder contains a script that is able to deal with the Burrows-Wheeler transform.
More precisely the script is able to do multiple tasks.
Given a genome sequence T, there are multiple functions able to calculate its BWT, its reverse.
Additionally, given an other sequence P, the script is able to find all matches of P in T exploiting the BWT.
All the details about how to run the program are localised in the script its self as commented lines.
